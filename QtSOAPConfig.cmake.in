# A QtSOAP build tree may provide either one or multiple build
# configurations depending on the CMake generator used.
# Since QtSOAP can be used either from a build tree or an install
# tree it is useful for outside projects to know the configurations available.
# If this QtSOAPConfig.cmake is in a QtSOAP install
# tree QtSOAP_CONFIGURATION_TYPES will be empty and
# QtSOAP_BUILD_TYPE will be set to the value of
# CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE used to build QtSOAP. If QtSOAPConfig.cmake
# is in a QtSOAP build tree then QtSOAP_CONFIGURATION_TYPES
# and QtSOAP_BUILD_TYPE will have values matching CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES
# and CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE for that build tree (only one will ever be set).
