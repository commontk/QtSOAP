# A QtSOAP install tree always provides one build configuration. 
# A QtSOAP build tree may provide either one or multiple build 
# configurations depending on the CMake generator used. 
# Since QtSOAP can be used either from a build tree or an install 
# tree it is useful for outside projects to know the configurations available. 
# If this QtSOAPConfig.cmake is in a QtSOAP install 
# tree QtSOAP_CONFIGURATION_TYPES will be empty and 
# QtSOAP_BUILD_TYPE will be set to the value of
# CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE used to build QtSOAP. If QtSOAPConfig.cmake 
# is in a QtSOAP build tree then QtSOAP_CONFIGURATION_TYPES 
# and QtSOAP_BUILD_TYPE will have values matching CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES 
# and CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE for that build tree (only one will ever be set).
